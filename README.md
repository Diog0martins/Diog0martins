<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diogo Martins!</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a Software Engineer from Portugal with a strong interest in Cybersecurity and Software Development. I'm currently working towards a Master's degree in Cybersecurity and have previous experience working as a Project Manager intern. Lately, Iâ€™ve been focused on building new projects to deepen my practical skills, especially in cybersecurity. I also enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, a fun (and humbling) way to learn more about real-world vulnerabilities.<p>
